  <font color= "pink"> <div class="desc">Your historical female role model should be Clara Barton! Clarissa Harlowe Barton, born December 25, 1821, was a battlefield nurse, teacher, and the founder of the American Red Cross. Barton began to serve her country, unprompted, by taking care of our nation’s soldiers, saving countless lives and encouraging others to do the same. In addition to her medical triumphs, Barton ran the Office of the Missing Soldiers, where she identified, and contacted the loved ones with missing relatives, who had been killed in action. Barton brought closure to hundreds of families. Barton also founded the First American Red Cross, an organization of donors, volunteers and employees specializing in life saving skills. After being forced into resignation, because of her controversial leadership style, Barton went on to found the National First Aid Society. Barton’s legacy lives on as her life-saving skills and ideas contribute to countless lives today.  </div></font>
